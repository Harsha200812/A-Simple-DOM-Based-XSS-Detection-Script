# Building an AI-Assisted Agent for Detecting DOM-Based XSS

## Introduction
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most prevalent security vulnerabilities in web applications, often exploited by attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers. While traditional security scanners detect common XSS flaws, modern AI-powered agents can significantly enhance detection accuracy by mimicking how security researchers think and analyze code.

In this blog, I introduce an **LLM-assisted DOM-Based XSS detection agent**, designed to identify vulnerabilities within JavaScript code. This project is part of my cybersecurity learning journey, showcasing how AI can be leveraged for automated security analysis.

## Understanding DOM-Based XSS
Unlike reflected or stored XSS, **DOM-Based XSS** occurs when malicious user input is processed directly within the browserâ€™s Document Object Model (DOM). This means the payload never reaches the server, making it harder to detect with traditional security tools.

### **Example of a DOM-Based XSS Attack**
```javascript
var userInput = document.location.hash.substring(1);
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = userInput; // Vulnerable
```
Here, the application takes input from `document.location.hash`, which an attacker can manipulate to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.

## Designing the Detection Agent
To automate the detection of such vulnerabilities, I developed a Python-based static analysis tool that:
âœ… **Scans JavaScript code** to identify untrusted sources (e.g., `document.URL`, `window.name`).
âœ… **Detects dangerous sinks** (e.g., `innerHTML`, `eval`, `document.write`).
âœ… **Analyzes data flow** to find XSS-prone patterns.
âœ… **Provides actionable reports** for security researchers.

### **How It Works**
The agent processes JavaScript code using pattern matching and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis. It then highlights potential vulnerabilities where untrusted input reaches an insecure sink.

### **Example Detection Output**
```
Potential DOM-Based XSS found: User-controlled input from 'document.location' flows into 'innerHTML' without sanitization.
```

## Implementation
Hereâ€™s a snippet of the detection logic in Python:
```python
import re

def find_xss_vulnerabilities(js_code):
    sources = ["document.URL", "document.location", "window.name"]
    sinks = ["innerHTML", "eval", "document.write"]
    vulnerabilities = []
    for line in js_code.split("\n"):
        for source in sources:
            for sink in sinks:
                if re.search(f"{source}.*{sink}", line, re.IGNORECASE):
                    vulnerabilities.append(f"Potential XSS: {line.strip()}")
    return vulnerabilities
```

## Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ **Integrating AI models** to enhance pattern recognition and reasoning.
ðŸ”¹ **Supporting dynamic analysis** with browser automation tools.
ðŸ”¹ **Providing mitigation strategies** for detected vulnerabilities.

## Final Thoughts
This project highlights how **AI-assisted security tools** can help detect sophisticated vulnerabilities like DOM-Based XSS. By combining **static code analysis** with **AI-driven reasoning**, we can develop smarter, more efficient security solutions.

Iâ€™m excited to continue improving this agent and exploring AI-powered cybersecurity tools. If youâ€™re interested in collaborating or have feedback, feel free to reach out!
